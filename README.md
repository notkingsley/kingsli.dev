You will need to rename the [`template.config.json`](./src/template.config.json) file to `config.json` and populate it with your own information.

You will also need to populate the [`src/content`](./src/content/) directory with your own content for the /about, /projects, /work, /old/projects and /old/work pages. The schemas are defined in [config.ts](./src/content/config.ts).
